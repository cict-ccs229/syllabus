#### Instructor
Mark Joseph J. Solidarios, [mjsolidarios@wvsu.edu.ph](mjsolidarios@wvsu.edu.ph)

#### Requirements
* (Optional) A GitHub account and knowledge of using Git.
* Must demonstrate "good programming style"
 * Use Object-Oriented Programming
 * Functions should be short (see [Sandi Metz's rules for developers](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/50655960596/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers))
 * Code should be optimized for readability
 * Source code submissions should be accompanied by a README.md file which include a short description of your work.
* Basic understanding of App Development Framework (Flutter, Qt, React...etc).
* Basic knowledge of multi-platform development.

> These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts.

## Homeworks/Projects
> Source code files of homeworks and projects should be submitted personally or by using GitHub.

If you're using GitHub Desktop, [these instructions](https://help.github.com/Desktop/guides/contributing/) will help explain the Git/GitHub concepts. Here are the overall steps:
 1. Fork the assigned repository (will be announced in class).
 1. Clone your forked repository into your hard drive.
 1. Make some changes to your repository.
   - Create your working directory named with your full name **[lastname_firstname]** (if group, your names should be separated by a dash).
   - Copy the contents of the **prefab/boilerplate** into your working directory.
   - Modify your local repository to comply with the task requirements (TBG - to be given).
 1. When you're satisfied with your output, commit your code and push it to your own repository.
 1. Create a pull request to the original repository. If you don't know how, check out [how you can create a pull request on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
 1. Your teacher will evaluate your work, give feedback in the pull request and merge it to the assigned repository once approved.
 1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the close date (TBA - to be announced) – just add a comment in the pull request to let your teacher know it's been updated.

### Reminders
* Please observe computer laboratory rules. Rules are posted inside the room.
* Laboratory workstations have limitations when it comes to local or external disks access, network sharing is also prohibited so please do inform your teacher if you need to transfer your files. A local FTP server is also hosted in class to assist to with file transfer transactions.
* Always backup your working directory.
* Using AI, reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development. As a professional developer you will never write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers and use the necessary tools to improve your development workflow.  I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and effort on taking this class.
* Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment especially if you use AI.
* Don't forget to check what kind of open source license a source code have. You may want to visit [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com) for more information.
